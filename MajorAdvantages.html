Mobile computing has changed the complete landscape of our day-to-day life. Following are the major advantages of Mobile Computing âˆ’

Location Flexibility
This has enabled users to work from anywhere as long as there is a connection established. A user can work without being in a fixed position. 
Their mobility ensures that they are able to carry out numerous tasks at the same time and perform their stated jobs.

Saves Time
The time consumed or wasted while travelling from different locations or to the office and back, has been slashed. One can now access all the important documents and files over a secure channel or portal and work as if they were on their computer.
 It has enhanced telecommuting in many companies. It has also reduced unnecessary incurred expenses.

Enhanced Productivity
Users can work efficiently and effectively from whichever location they find comfortable. This in turn enhances their productivity level.

Ease of Research
Research has been made easier, since users earlier were required to go to the field and search for facts and feed them back into the system.
 It has also made it easier for field officers and researchers to collect and feed data from wherever they are without making unnecessary trips to and from the office to the field.
